=====================

Template for scikit-learn (Machine Learning in Python)

This template is a stripped-down template for working with scikit-learn. It is based on an image classification project I worked on. It reads data from a CSV file and calculates the histograms for the files in that CSV file. The data source as well as the classifier can be cached (serialized via pickle).
